# Cuzzo io

Open `index.html` in Chrome (double-click works). Online play needs an internet connection; singleplayer practice works offline.

```

Textures are bundled into `textures.js` because browsers refuse to give WebGL images
loaded straight from `file://`. If you edit or replace a PNG, rebuild with
`python3 tools/build_textures.py`... though note the script redraws every PNG from code,
so to keep a hand-edited PNG, remove its block from the script first.

Texture letters: `p` plaster, `b` brick, `w` wood siding, `x` crate, `m` corrugated metal,
`c` concrete, `f` ground/grass detail, `g` skyscraper windows, `t` roof shingles,
`o` door planks, `r` rock, `e` glow, `z` thatch, `2` coral stone, `4` dock planks, `5` ice blocks, plus newer floor/road/siding textures
(see `tools/build_textures.py` for the full list).

## v6.2: public and private rooms
- The main menu has a **Rooms** list. Public rooms show a Join button. Private rooms show with a lock and no code, so you need the code from the host.
- Hosts pick **Public** or **Private** in the lobby (it remembers your choice). The list shows the room name, mode, map, players and whether a match is on.
- Runs on the same Cloudflare Worker as the relay, now in the `server` folder. Deploy it with `npx wrangler deploy` (see SERVER_SETUP.md). Until it's set up, the game works like before with codes only.

## v6.1: TURN relay through Cloudflare
- Players whose networks block direct connections (phone data, schools) can now connect through a Cloudflare TURN relay. Follow SERVER_SETUP.md to set it up; until you do, the game plays exactly as before.
- The secret key stays inside a Cloudflare Worker (`server/src/index.js`), which only answers your own site, rate-limits requests and hands out logins that expire after 4 hours.

## v6.0: ready to publish - mobile support, faster on weak computers
- **Phones and tablets**: the game detects touch screens and shows on-screen controls. Left thumb anywhere on the left side = joystick (push all the way up to sprint), right thumb = look around. Buttons: FIRE (drag on it to aim while shooting), AIM, JUMP, CROUCH, RELOAD, SWAP, USE, POWER, and BAG/DROP in Battle Royale. Tap a weapon slot to switch, tap the on-screen prompt to use it, MAP and pause buttons at the top. Phones go full screen in landscape when you start (where the browser allows it) and ask you to turn the device sideways if it's upright. Settings has a touch look sensitivity slider. Add `?touch=1` to the URL to test touch controls on a computer, or `?touch=0` to turn them off.
- **Graphics quality** (Settings > Graphics) is now Auto / Low / Medium / High. Auto starts on Low for phones, tablets and weak computers (4 or fewer CPU cores, 4 GB RAM or less, or a known slow graphics chip) and Medium otherwise, and if a match drops under about 40 fps it lowers the resolution step by step and then the quality level. Medium uses cheaper 1024 hard-edged shadows; Low also swaps to simpler lighting. The browser is asked for the faster graphics chip on laptops that have two.
- Fixed the sky turning into a black dome on Low (the shorter view distance was cutting the sky off).
- Removed the old real-town Squads map and its map data (the download is about 700 KB smaller and loads faster). Squads is played on Pine Lake and Sunset Bay.
- Removed a hidden cheat skin (aimbot, 1000 health, extra speed and a one-hit weapon unlocked by spinning the skin picker). Damage sent by other players is now capped at a sane maximum, and unknown skin numbers from other players fall back to the default skin.

## v5.1: kick, no more double joins, Big Fat Chum
- The host can kick players: click the red x next to their name in the lobby's player list. They're sent back to the main menu and can't rejoin that lobby.
- Fixed players sometimes joining twice (showing up as two copies). If a connection says hello more than once, or someone refreshes and reconnects, the host now keeps just one of them.
- New skin: Big Fat Chum - a really fat, ugly guy with his gut hanging out of a stained tank top, a double chin, a unibrow and a gross face.

## v4.9.2: every skin is the same
- All skin perks are gone - skins are just looks now. Every skin has 100 health, runs at the same speed and makes the same footstep sounds (Survivor's 200 health, Astronaut's 140 health, Curly's extra speed and Stealth's silent footsteps are removed).
- The skin picker just shows each skin's name (no descriptions).
- Sneaking (crouch) still hides your footsteps for everyone.

## v4.9: performance mode
- New setting: Settings > Graphics > Performance mode. Turn it on if the game is laggy on a slower computer (like a school Chromebook).
- It renders at a lower resolution, turns off shadows, hides grass, clouds and falling snow, shortens the view distance, redraws the minimap less often and turns off antialiasing. In testing it ran about 4-6x more frames per second on a slow machine.
- It switches on and off instantly and remembers your choice. (Only the antialiasing part waits until you reload the page.)

## v4.8: two new Squads maps
- **Pine Lake**: a lake town in the pine hills - Lakeview's main street of shops and two side streets of houses, Pine Hollow, a cabin village on the north shore with a dock and rowing boats, an island with a lookout, a farm with a barn and two silos you can climb, Millbrook village, a sawmill, a hill ranch with a corral, a crossroads diner and gas station, Riverside across the river, three bridges (wooden, stone and a rope footbridge) and a lakeside campground.
- **Sunset Bay**: a seaside city - downtown blocks of shops and offices, a hillside neighbourhood, Bluff Estates villas, beach houses with lifeguard towers and umbrellas, a trailer park, the harbor with warehouses and a long pier, a lighthouse on the rocky headland you can climb to the lamp room, a vineyard, a sports field and a quarry in the hills.
- 5 drivable cars on each map, parked on the roads. Every house is open: all the doors work and every staircase, basement, tower, pier and bridge was tested (cars can drive over the wooden and stone bridges).
- Squads visual audio only shows enemies: your teammates' footsteps and gunshots no longer show on the ring.

## v4.7: the practice bot fights back
- In singleplayer practice the bot now hunts you down: it runs at you, finds its way around walls, circle-strafes and jumps when it gets close, and keeps its distance.
- It shoots back with a rifle in bursts (10 damage a hit, 20 for a headshot) and reloads after 30 shots. Its aim is a bit off at first and gets better the longer it can see you, so breaking line of sight helps.
- It only shoots when it can actually see you, its bullets fly like yours and show on the visual-audio ring, and it can eliminate you (you respawn as normal).

## v4.6: no more cheats
- Removed the /boituff67 (aimbot, super speed, +900 health) and /bigsuperbomb (nuke) chat codes. Typing them now just sends a normal chat message.

## v4.5: Battle Royale looting
- Battle Royale maps have no vending machines (and no coins). You drop in with just a pickaxe (X) and 5 empty slots (1-5).
- Gold chests are in a lot of houses (not every one) and tucked into bushes or next to rocks outside. Walk up and press E to open one: a gun and 1-2 other items pop out onto the ground. Press E on an item to pick it up.
- Chests sparkle, hum and show on the visual-audio ring, but only when you're really close (about 12 m).
- Guns: Pistol (50 damage, 3 seconds between shots), SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle.
- 5 rarities, each with its own colour: Common (grey), Uncommon (green), Rare (blue), Epic (purple), Legendary (gold). Higher rarity means more damage, tighter aim and faster reloads.
- Bandages: +15 health each, up to 75% health, 3 s to use, stack to 15. Shield potions: +50 shield, up to 100, 4 s to drink, stack to 3. Grenades: throw them for up to 75 damage in a 7 m blast, stack to 6.
- Tab opens your inventory: drag items to move them around, drag onto DROP or right-click to drop. G drops what you're holding.
- Picking something up with a full inventory swaps it with the item you're holding. When you're eliminated everything you carried falls on the ground.

## v4.4: real bullets
- Shots are no longer instant: every bullet flies through the air at its own speed (sniper fastest, shotgun pellets slowest and short-range), so you lead moving targets on long shots.
- Bullets drop a little over long distances (a sniper shot drops about a quarter metre at 150 m and about a metre at 300 m), and you can see them streak through the air.
- Guns are more accurate: pistol, rifle and sniper spread is roughly halved.
- Headshots still do double damage, and other players see your bullets fly too.

## v4.3: back to the classic guns

- Every skin has the same four guns again: pistol, rifle, shotgun and sniper (keys 1-4). Skin perks that aren't weapons stay: Survivor 200 health, Curly runs faster, Stealth's footsteps are silent, Astronaut 140 health

## v4.2: hot lava

- Volcano Isle: the lava in the crater and in the two lava channels now burns you for 25 health a second (shields soak it first). The screen glows orange while you're in it; the crater rim and the ground beside the channels are safe. Burning to death shows as "Lava eliminated ..."

## v4.0: every skin has its own weapons, Josh Rice, sneaking

**Each skin now has its own loadout** (shown in the outfit picker; the weapon bar and keys 1/2 follow your skin)
- **Survivor**: 200 health, AR (automatic rifle)
- **Curly**: shotgun, runs 1.5x faster
- **Tennis**: tennis racket (melee, 40 a hit) and infinite tennis balls thrown fast (20 a hit)
- **Stealth**: sniper with unlimited range (80 body, 160 headshot); his footsteps never show on the visual sound icons
- **Cowboy**: six-shooter and a whip that reaches about 7 m (30 a hit)
- **Ninja**: ninja stars with decent range (20 each) and a silent pistol whose shots never show on the visual sound icons
- **Astronaut**: ray gun that shoots through houses with unlimited range, 140 health
- **Knight**: longsword (90 a hit) and crossbow (10)
- **Farmer**: corn grenades that burst into popcorn (60 up close) and pitchforks thrown at medium range (20)
- **Josh Rice** (new): beret, striped shirt and a big curly mustache. His baguette does 1 damage
- Headshots on thrown weapons and guns still do double damage; melee doesn't. Thrown weapons and melee never need reloading

**Sneaking**: hold C (rebindable) to crouch. You move slowly, can't sprint, and your footsteps don't show on anyone's visual sound icons. You're also a smaller target

## v3.9.2: two Battle Buses in Squads

- Squads now starts with two Battle Buses at opposite ends of the same route, flying toward each other. Squad 1 rides bus 1 (blue dot on the big map), Squad 2 rides bus 2 (red dot), so the squads drop in from opposite sides

## v3.9.1: map choice follows the mode


## v3.9: Squads with drivable cars, 10 new maps, third person, glitch fixes

**New mode: Squads**
- Two squads of up to 4. In the lobby the host clicks a player to move them to the other squad (new players join the smaller squad)
- No friendly fire: your bullets pass your squadmates and their hits never hurt you
- Squadmates' name tags (green) and health bars are always shown, through walls and at any distance, and each squadmate is an arrow with their name on the minimap and the big map. When you are eliminated you spectate a squadmate first

- A sedan, pickup truck, SUV, sports car, minivan, hatchback, jeep, muscle car, station wagon and police cruiser, built to real-world size with wheels, lights, mirrors and bumpers; each drives a bit differently (the sports and muscle cars are fastest)
- They are clearly not the parked cars: detailed bodies, a floating DRIVE sign over empty ones, and the parked cars are still the simple blocky ones
- Press E next to a car to get in: the first one in drives, up to 3 more ride as passengers. E again gets you out beside the car
- W accelerates, S brakes and then reverses, A/D steer. Cars climb kerbs, stop against buildings and other cars, and won't drive into the river
- No shooting from a car. The camera follows behind the car (move the mouse to look around)
- All 10 cars are always shown on the minimap and the big map, even while someone is driving (gold outline = someone inside)

**Third-person view**
- Settings > Camera > Point of view: First person or Third person (remembered). Third person is an over-the-shoulder camera that pulls in near walls and closer while aiming; the sniper scope still switches to the scope view

**5 new free-for-all arenas** (smaller, tighter maps)
- **Neon Alley**: a city block at night with neon on every shop, arcades and offices, rooftop fire escapes, a glowing plaza and billboards
- **Rust Refinery**: storage tanks you can climb, a catwalk between them, pipe racks to duck under and a flare stack
- **Lakeside Camp**: cabins round a campfire, a mess hall, a lake with a dock and canoes, an archery range and a lookout tower
- **Colosseum**: a Roman amphitheatre with seating tiers you can climb, four entrance tunnels, a spina with an obelisk, and a forum outside
- **Rail Yard**: five tracks of freight trains (walk through the boxcars), a station platform, a footbridge over the tracks and an engine shed

**5 new Battle Royale maps** (each a little bigger than Coral Key)
- **Volcano Isle**: climb to the glowing lava crater, cross the lava channels, a fishing village, beach hotel, research domes and a plantation, inside a buoy line
- **Dune Sea**: an oasis town with domes and a bazaar, a desert fort, an oil field with derricks, a crashed airliner and buried ruins
- **Redwood Valley**: giant redwoods along a river, a logging town, a sawmill, covered, stone and rope bridges, fire lookouts and a campground
- **Fort Ironclad**: a fenced military base with a runway, hangars, control tower, barracks, bunkers, watchtowers, tanks, a helipad and a radar dome, plus a town outside the gate
- **Savanna Safari**: acacia plains, a safari lodge, a village of round huts, a watering hole with a lookout, granite kopjes, a giant baobab and animals

**Funfair Park is now a real carnival**
- A midway of striped game booths along the paths (prize bears, ring toss, lights), a circus big top with a ring and bleachers, a wave swinger, teacups, a pirate ship, a helter-skelter you can climb, a food court with tents and picnic tables, popcorn and candy-floss carts, balloons, ticket booths, bins and bunting between the lamps
- Fixed: round things (the carousel base, tanks, drums) were never drawn on any map; they now are

**Fixes**
- Stairs and roofs: you no longer get pushed up into a ceiling, lintel or roof when going up stairs or jumping under something. A step up is only taken if your head fits, and jumps stop at the ceiling. Checked on every staircase of every map (walking, sprinting, jumping and at low frame rates)
- The "pushed into the ground at the edge of a house" glitch: houses with basements dig the ground out beneath them, and the dip reached up to 1.5 m outside the walls under a concrete strip you could fall through. That strip is now solid (Bazaar, Graveyard, Frostpeak, Pleasant Park and others)

## v3.8: host map picking fixed

- "Host picks" now really lets the host pick: the map picture and the Choose map button show up in
  the online lobby (an old style rule was hiding them). The map list opens straight away and the
  previews fill in as you look.
- If the browser refuses to capture the mouse when a match starts (it can happen when a big map like
  appears instead of leaving the controls dead. One click and you're in.

## v3.7: one-click start, host picks any map

- When the host presses Start, everyone in the lobby is pulled straight into the match. Nobody has
  to press Join. If the browser needs a click before it will capture the mouse, a "The match has
  started - click anywhere to play" screen appears, and one click puts you in.
- With "Map choice: Host picks", the host's map list now has every map (all 21), with maps for the
  current mode listed first. Battle Royale can be played on an arena map and free-for-all on a
  Battle Royale map.

## v3.6: vending banks, coins over time

- Vending machines now stand together in a bank of four (Heal, Cloak, Speed, Shield) on every map, so
  wherever you find one you can buy any power-up. The minimap shows each bank as a four-colour square.
- Coins: you earn 1 coin every minute you're alive in a match, and 2 coins for every elimination.
  The HUD counter now says COINS, and the machines show their price in coins.
  - Real elevation changes: the town rises toward the south-west and falls toward the east and the
    river. Streets roll gently, and the open land between neighbourhoods has hills and draws (a 100 m
    difference from low to high). The airport, parks, fields and parking lots stay flat.
  - Yards: every house gets a lot squared off along its street, with wood, white or grey
    fences down the sides and across the back (front yards stay open). Bigger back yards get a shed
    and a tree. The fences are solid, so they work as cover.

## v3.4: practice on any map, more clean-up

- Single-player practice: the map picker lists all 20 maps, so you can play free-for-all against the target bot on any map, including the Battle Royale maps. When you leave practice, the normal multiplayer map lists are back to how they were
- Fixed: chimneys started a metre below the roof, so a brick block hung from the ceiling of top-floor rooms
- Fixed: on market stalls that face sideways, the goods hung in the air past the end of the counter (Dustyard, Bazaar and other stall areas)
- Removed things that looked like random or floating objects in houses:
  - wall shelves with ornaments
  - wall-mounted record racks
  - cobweb sheets
  - rooftop solar panels
  - trunks, ottomans, hampers, shoe racks, console tables and loose boxes used as filler
- Display cabinets now have wooden shelves instead of see-through glass ones, so their ornaments visibly rest on something
- An automated check of every box on every map found no other unsupported objects. What it still flags is meant to hang or be held up: chairlift chairs, pier steps going into the water, bridge planks, carousel poles, chandeliers, and stall roofs and gates on their posts

## v3.3: tidy-up and bug fixes

- Only things that belong in the middle of a room stand there:
  - rugs, coffee tables in front of sofas, dining sets, kitchen islands and pool tables
  - in shops, the shelving aisles, display cases and café tables
- Armchairs, cabinets, shelves, wardrobes, beds and lamps always go against a wall, in every building
- Fixed: table and nightstand lamps were drawn at floor level inside or under the furniture; they now sit on top
- Fixed floating wall paint:
  - above the low office walls inside warehouses
  - beside the open stairwell in upstairs lofts
- Fixed: pictures could hang above the low parapet on roof terraces
- Loose things on the floor (cups, papers, toys) now only appear in messy homes (students, parties, people moving) and kids' rooms
- Removed a stray log box that stuck out beside wood stoves
- New automated checks:
  - every piece of furniture stands on a floor
  - every picture, shelf and wall panel has a wall behind it

## v3.2: roomier interiors, more varied layouts

- Rooms are less cluttered:
  - at most one bookshelf and one table set per home room
  - no tall furniture standing in the middle of the floor
  - armchairs and similar pieces stay against walls
  - much less loose stuff on the floor
  - walkways are at least about 1.1 m wide
- More varied floor plans:
  - about a third of houses are now single-storey
  - a new multi-room layout puts two rooms off a back hallway next to an open kitchen and living room
  - about half the basements are behind their own door at the top of the stairs
  - very small cabins are one open room instead of two cramped ones
- Fixed: on maps with sea level, basements could be dug below the waterline and flooded; houses there now only get a basement when its floor stays dry

## v3.1: every building is different inside and out

Houses, shops and other buildings on every map now get their own layout, their own use and their own furniture.

**Outside**
- Street lots come in different shapes:
  - ranch houses: wide and low
  - cottages: small, with steep roofs
  - modern flat-roofed houses with roof terraces
  - deeper houses
  - mirrored floor plans (stairs on the other side)
- Extra details: balconies you can walk out onto, window flower boxes, porch chairs and benches, AC units and satellite dishes
- Some lots are businesses, each with a coloured shop sign, a striped awning over a big shop window and a matching interior:
  - **Towns:** café, diner, grocery, pharmacy, bar, bakery, hardware store, clothes shop, barber, laundromat, bookshop, arcade, gym, clinic, pizzeria, toy shop, florist
  - **Canyon Mesa:** saloon, sheriff's office with jail cells, bank with a vault, general store, hotel, blacksmith, undertaker, post office
  - **Sakura Gardens:** ramen shops and tea houses with tatami floors
  - **Highland Castle village:** taverns and a smithy
  - **Tropical maps:** tiki bars, surf shops and fish markets
  - **Snow maps:** a ski shop and the ski lodge
  - **Port Harbor and Bayou Swamp:** bait shops
- Warehouses each have a use: storage racks with pallets and a forklift, a car garage with a lift, a factory, a boxing gym, a market hall, an aircraft hangar, a sugar mill, a fish market or a shipyard
- Lunar Outpost buildings are a lab, a hydroponics farm, a dorm, a mess hall and a command center
- Castle keeps have a great hall with a throne, a lord's chamber, a library and an armory. Forts have barracks, and the Temple Ruins buildings are full of rubble, broken columns, urns, altars and statues
- The Funfair mansion is now a haunted house

**Inside**
- Rooms are laid out differently from house to house:
  - a separate kitchen or an open-plan kitchen and living room
  - a side bedroom or study on the ground floor
  - one, two or three rooms upstairs
  - bathrooms, laundry rooms and hallways
- Every room is furnished for its use, with over 100 kinds of furniture. Each piece is placed so it never blocks a door, stairs or a tall window
- Each house belongs to a different kind of household, so no two homes look alike:
  - a family with kids' rooms and toys
  - a student with a mattress on the floor and pizza boxes
  - an elderly couple with a grandfather clock and rocking chair
  - a gamer with arcade machines
  - an artist with easels, or a musician with drums and guitars
  - a fitness fan with a home gym, or a bookworm with walls of books
  - a pet owner with an aquarium, a cat tree and a dog bed
  - people moving house (boxes everywhere) or renovating (ladders and paint)
  - a prepper with stocked shelves, or someone just after a party
- Walls are painted, papered or tiled per room. Floors are wood, carpet, tile or stone. Rugs, pictures, shelves, mirrors, clocks and a ceiling light (flush, pendant, fan or chandelier) are added per room
- Basements become rec rooms, workshops, storage rooms, home gyms, laundry rooms, home theatres, prepper bunkers, wine cellars or band rooms
- Downtown office towers have a different use on every floor: offices, cubicles, meeting rooms, a cafeteria, a gym, a server room, a lounge, storage or a lab
- Graveyard houses are abandoned: dusty, with debris and cobwebs

**Checks**
- An automated check walks every floor of every building with the player's size and collision rules. Every door and staircase stays reachable, and furniture never seals off part of a room

**Performance**
- The world is drawn as one mesh per texture instead of one per colour
- Furniture doesn't cast shadows and is skipped when you're far from it
- Collisions and bullets only test nearby objects

## v3.0: 10 new Battle Royale maps

These maps only appear in Battle Royale map voting. They range from about Pleasant Park's
size up to Seven Isles, which is a little bigger than Coral Key.

- **Canyon Mesa**: a western town on red mesas with a deep canyon. It has a railway with a
  train and station, a canyon trestle bridge, a water tower, a corral, a windpump and cacti
- **Port Harbor**: a seaside town and container port. It has a quay with cranes, a cargo
  ship you can board, stacked containers and a fishing pier
- **Autumn Hollow**: an orange-and-red forest farm town. It has silos, a corn maze you can
  get lost in, pumpkin patches, hay bales, a scarecrow and a windmill
- **Sakura Gardens**: a Japanese village in cherry blossoms. It has a pagoda, a torii-gate
  path, a koi pond with a bridge, stone lanterns, a zen garden and bamboo
- **Temple Ruins**: a jungle with a 7-tier step pyramid you can climb, with a temple on
  top. It also has a column avenue, obelisks, a river with stone and rope bridges, and palms
- **Lunar Outpost**: a moon base with low gravity (you jump much higher), with craters and
  the Earth in the sky. It has a hub dome and four domes joined by corridors, a rocket pad
  with a climbable gantry, solar arrays, rovers and a radar mast
- **Bayou Swamp**: stilt houses on winding swamp channels, with boardwalks, a paddle
  riverboat, rowboats, lily pads and dead trees
- **Highland Castle**: a walled castle on a hill with a gate, towers and a keep. It also
  has a river with stone bridges, a jousting field with tents, a village and a windmill
- **Funfair Park**: a carousel, a ferris wheel, a roller coaster with a track you can walk,
  bumper cars, a drop tower, food stalls and an entrance gate
- **Seven Isles**: seven islands joined by wooden bridges. The big central island has a
  town and a keep. There are also a fishing island, a shipyard, a stone watchtower, camps,
  a shipwreck and swimming between islands, with buoys marking the border
- Map previews are now made only when needed, so the menu loads as fast as before

## v2.9: bigger bus, softer snow, igloo upgrades

- The Battle Bus is about 2.4x bigger (the camera pulls back to fit it)
- Snowdrift Valley is less glaring: darker exposure and sky, greyer snow with more shading
  variation so slopes, paths and objects stand out
- Igloo interior: ice bridges join the four raised platforms into a walkway loop around the
  stage, glowing crystal clusters in four colours along the walls, hanging banners, penguin
  ice sculptures around the stage, snow drifts for cover and log benches by the fires
- The igloo is drawn on the minimap and big map as a dome with its four tunnels

## v2.8: battle bus, voting, chat, winter map

- Battle Royale starts on the Battle Bus: it flies across the map under a hot-air balloon,
  press E to jump, skydive, and your glider opens automatically near the ground (steer with
  WASD while falling). Anyone still on board is kicked off at the end of the route. The bus
  route is drawn on the map, and the storm timer only starts once the bus has crossed
- Map voting in the lobby: 3 maps for the selected mode, everyone (host included) gets one
  vote, the most-voted map is played when the host starts (ties are picked at random)
- Quick chat: press / during a match, type, Enter sends it to everyone (rebindable)
- Visual sound: footprint icons around the crosshair point at nearby players walking or
  running (within about 25 m), and bullet icons point at gunfire up to ~110 m away
- Damage numbers float above players you hit (yellow for headshots)
- "YOU DIED - eliminated by ..." message in free-for-all
- Inventory slots show your Heal and Cloak powerups with counts and the selected one
- Fixed: the host could get several kills for one kill; every death is now counted once
- Wider stairs everywhere, much bigger basements (with a ping-pong table, sofa and shelves)
- Most bushes are now small; about one in five is still big enough to hide in
- New Battle Royale map: Snowdrift Valley, as big as Coral Key, ringed by mountains, with a
  giant enterable igloo in the middle (four tunnels, a glowing ice stage, raised platforms
  with stairs, pillars and cover), a pine village, a ski lodge with a chairlift, a frozen lake
  with ice-fishing huts, a research station with a radio mast, a ranger hamlet, snowmen and
  falling snow

## v2.7: multiplayer fixes

- Fixed: when the host shot someone, the hit was sent to every player, so everybody took
  the damage (and often died). Hits now go only to the player who was hit, and players ignore
  any hit that isn't addressed to them
- Removed an old duplicate copy of the networking code that could confuse message handling
- Doors opened by one player are no longer sent to everyone twice
- Palm trees no longer have an invisible tall pole above their curved trunks that blocked shots
- Small performance fix for the crosshair

## v2.6: stairs, roofs, moving storm

- Stairs: every staircase now starts with a flat landing you walk onto, so you can't get
  stuck against the first steps; the opening above is wider so you don't hit your head on the
  floor above; basements have a landing at the bottom so you can always walk back up
- Roofs are solid: you can stand on a roof but you can no longer glitch inside one
- Battle Royale storm moves like Fortnite: each new circle lands somewhere random inside the
  current one (shown as a dashed ring on the map), and the storm slides towards it as it
  shrinks; on Coral Key the small late circles always end up over land

## v2.5: Coral Key (new Battle Royale map)

- A huge tropical island, about twice the area of Royale Isle, picked from the Battle Royale
  map list
- Harbour town with pastel houses, a fish market, market stalls and piers with moored boats
- Beach resort: two-storey hotel, a pool you can wade in, a tiki bar, thatched cabanas,
  sun loungers and umbrellas, a lifeguard tower, bungalows and a roped-off swimming area with
  a floating raft
- Cliff fort on the north-west plateau: stone walls with battlements you can climb onto,
  corner towers, cannons, two gates and a keep with a roof you can reach
- Jungle river crossing the island, with a plank road bridge and two rope footbridges
- Airstrip with runway, hangar, control tower, fuel drums and a parked plane
- Sugar-cane fields (tall cane you can hide in) and an old stone sugar mill with a chimney
- Fishing shacks on stilts on the north shore, coral rocks, hundreds of palm trees
- No stone wall around the edge: a line of floating red-and-white buoys marks the border
- Swimming: deep water floats you at the surface; you swim slower, can't sprint, jump or
  aim while swimming, and walk back out wherever the beach slopes up
- The storm starts bigger on this map so it covers the whole island

## v2.4: aiming and settings

- Hold the aim button (right mouse by default) to aim down sights with any gun; let go to stop
- Pistol, rifle and shotgun get a light zoom and tighter spread while aiming; only the sniper
  has the big scope (and is pinpoint accurate when scoped)
- Shotgun: wider, even pellet spread (10 pellets) and a Fortnite-style ring crosshair that
  shows exactly where the pellets can land
- The crosshair gap on every gun now matches its real spread
- Settings (gear button): mouse sensitivity, aiming sensitivity and sniper scope sensitivity
  sliders, saved between sessions

## v2.3: spawn fixes

- Fixed Downtown spawning you inside a building where you couldn't move
- Every free-for-all map has 28 spread-out spawn points in open ground (never touching a
  building, wall, tree, rock, door or vending machine)
- Respawns pick a random spot from the safer half: away from enemies, away from where you
  died, and never the spot you used last time
- A final safety check moves you to the nearest clear ground if a spot is ever blocked
- Battle Royale drop spawns are unchanged

## v2.2: enterable city buildings

- Downtown has 8 office buildings you can walk into (E opens the front or back door)
- 4 to 6 floors each: a lobby with a reception desk, offices with desks and cubicles,
  ceiling lights and real glass windows
- A stairwell in the back corner goes up every floor and out onto the roof, where a
  small stair house sits behind a railing

## v2.1: polish and bug fixes

- Fixed flickering where two surfaces sat in the same spot (floor/ceiling edges against
  outside walls, window glass vs frames, corner trim vs foundation, wallpaper at door
  frames, and road/sidewalk crossings)
- Shadows no longer shimmer while you walk
- Houses are never placed on top of a crossing street; yard trees, street lamps and
  vending machines stay off roads, sidewalks and other houses; parked cars don't overlap
- Grass no longer grows through driveways, plazas or the gas station
- Yardline is flat ground now

## v2: map rebuild

- Every map is now generated as real neighbourhoods: streets and sidewalks, driveways,
  houses with proper rooms, interior walls with normal doorways, a single staircase per
  floor, windows instead of holes, porches, garages, fences and mailboxes
- Pleasant Park laid out like the Fortnite POI: a grid of streets around a central park
  with a gazebo, a soccer field, a gas station and two-storey suburban houses
- Some houses have basements (stairs down from the ground floor)
- Real doors: they look like doors, are normal size, and show "E  Open door" / "Close door"
- Fixed floating trees and rocks: everything sits on the ground
- Fixed stairs you couldn't climb: every step is low enough to walk up
- More materials used in the right places (siding, brick, stucco, wood floors, tile,
  carpet, ceilings, roads, sidewalks) and varied between houses
- Battle Royale storm no longer shoves you; it only damages you
- Battle Royale winner is the last player alive, not the first to get a kill

## Visual changes

- Blocky survivors with pixel faces, hair, hands and swappable outfits (9 total, new: Farmer)
- First-person arms holding each weapon
- Faceted low-poly terrain with per-triangle colour variation
- Low-poly pines, clustered leafy trees, faceted boulders, thousands of grass tufts and flowers
- Drifting low-poly clouds and an ocean on the horizon
- Chunky low-res textures for every building material
- Flat dark survival-game UI: status bars, hotbar, minimap, menus
- Main menu floats over a slow cinematic flyover of the selected map
- Loading screen
- Fixed: a timing bug at startup that could show a fake "CLOAKED" timer
